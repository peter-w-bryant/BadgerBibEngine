# BadgerBibEngine: https://badger-bib-engine.herokuapp.com/
A simple web-based database application for searching, uploading, and deleting bibliometric data! You can use the application at https://badger-bib-engine.herokuapp.com/. 

We are currently hosting the application and our MySQL database on Heroku's free tier and have thus maxed out our alotted DB space. This means creating new user accounts and using the edit interface is not available online. Feel free to use,
